    CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

    Ever since
    the virus was introduced to the world, countries have been trying to find a cure.
    Even societies collapsed and we were left with small civilizations of just over
    1000 people, there were those of us that didn''t give up. Every person doing
    their part from healing injured people, to trying to find a cure to stop the
    destruction of life on Earth, to teaching the next generation of humans how to
    survive, and to fighting the creatures head on, keeping them from destroying
    all that we have left. It is the will and determination of humans to survive
    that makes us strong. It is what allowed us to survive other deadly diseases
    and dangers that Mother Earth sent upon us. This time it''s different. This virus,
    this disease that we created was originally made to be a symbiote with the intent
    to enhance our physical capabilities, to increase our ability to survive and
    in turn allow us to live longer on this Earth. Instead, we created a deadly parasite
    that showed us what our biggest weakness is, greed. We were created with the
    ability to build civilizations from nothing, to manipulate raw materials to allow
    us to communicate from unfathomable distances, to reach places beyond our planet,
    yet there is one thing we can''t change, human greed. The parasite tricked our
    bodies, used our will to survive to manipulate us to steal the lives of all other
    living beings on the Earth, allowing it to spread and grow. It used our will
    to survive to make itself stronger and stole our humanity and ability to think
    and act freely. We beat Mother Nature but in the end, we caused our own downfall.
