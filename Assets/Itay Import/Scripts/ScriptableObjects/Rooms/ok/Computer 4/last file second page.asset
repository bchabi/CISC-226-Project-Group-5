    We had less than 500 people left and
    with the new mutation, we weren''t going to survive much longer. For the first
    time in history, there existed something with a will to survive that was stronger
    than ours. We had all given up hope. Until we found a cure. Our faith in our
    abilities was reignited. We were brought down to our knees, on the verge of extinction,
    and we now have the strength to deal the final blow that will prove that our
    potential is limitless and our will unbreakable. When triple checking to ensure
    that our cure works before letting everyone else know and releasing it into the
    world, we realized something. We realized what the next mutation of the virus
    will be. The changes that the virus was making to itself seemed similar to the
    changing effect that the cure will have on the virus. It seems that in the next
    mutation, the virus will no longer act parasitic. It will evolve and rather than
    fight for control with its host, it will properly connect with it and act symbiotic.
    We were marveled by what this could mean. It would mean that we would regain
    our consciousness and would be able to manipulate and use the abilities of the
    virus. We would be able to gain nutrients from plants and animals without needing
    anything but our hands. All of our senses would be heightened and we may even
    start to regain our eyesight. We would be able to turn invisible to protect ourselves
    from wild animals. We would be able to manipulate our black blood to create thin
    or thick layers on top of our skins to protect ourselves from physical damage.
    This would fulfill the very purpose for which the virus was created. Then we
    realized what the downside would be.
