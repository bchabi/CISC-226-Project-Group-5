    After regaining consciousness we would
    remember simple things like how to talk, read, write, but we would lose all memory
    of our life before the virus. Humanity would essentially be reset with enhanced
    capabilities. So we had a choice to make: cure everyone, giving them back their
    memories and returning everything to the way it was before the virus was created;
    or we could let the virus mutate, and have humanity start over but with a better
    ability to survive. This decision was not easy, we had the power to control the
    future of all humans. We knew that we were the ones that had to make the decision,
    we were the only ones who could understand where each path would lead us. We
    knew that the others wouldn''t consider resetting humanity. They wouldn''t have
    the strength to make that decision, even if it is the right thing to do. After
    thinking about it for a long time, considering the upsides and downsides of each
    decision, we finally came to a conclusion. We destroyed the cure and told the
    others that there wasn''t anything that could be done to stop the monsters. We
    also knew that for humanity to be properly reset, we had to destroy as much evidence
    of humans before the virus as we could. With the time that we had, we sent a
    virus to the safehouses with the hopes that it will destroy all the information
    that was backed up on them. The monsters are going to breach the city within
    the hour. We won''t ever know if our decision was the right one, but it made
    me realize something. Maybe greed isn''t a human weakness but rather a human
    strength. Maybe our never ending desire to want more than what we already have,
    our never ending thirst to become better, our inability to be satisfied with
    what we already have is the reason we have survived the things that we have.
    Maybe our greed is what gives us goals that are beyond our reach and our will
    and determination is what drives us to achieve the seemingly impossible goals.
    In that sense, we are truly perfect beings.
